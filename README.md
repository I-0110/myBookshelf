# MY BOOKSHELF

## Description

Our My Bookshelf is inspired by the need to have a bookshelf on the internet where I can save my personal favorite books . We created this project because I could not find a book website that accomodate to my needs. We resolved finding the perfect website that accomodate to my demands on a book website. We learned that creating a logical path between server and client can be complex and overwhelming.
